## Experience
#### Tencent, Software Development Engineer Intern
###### Nov 2019 – Jan 2020
###### Shenzhen, China 
###### C#, C++
* Worked on the Engine Optimization Team to improve the game engine used by other groups, gaining in-depth industry expertise in multiple internet-based platforms and experience with the software development cycle.  
* Designed and developed an optimized distributed fast builder system to implement free concurrent build for Unreal Engine 4 using C# and C++ via FastBuild, accelerating the build process of custom engine by approximately 40%. 
* Identified and developed industry-leading software leveraging Unreal Engine 4 build updates in collaboration with a 20-member development team.


## Education
#### University of California, San Diego
###### Sep 2020 – Mar 2023 (Expected)
###### Bachelor of Science in Data Science (GPA 3.9/4.0)
* Relevant Coursework: Java, Python, Data Structure Algorithm, Database, Scalable Systems, Advanced Algorithms for Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Processing and Analysis, Data Mining and Recommender Systems, Deep Learning

## Projects
#### Husky Map Website
###### Oct 2019
###### Java, HTML, JavaScript, CSS
* Applied full-stack software development skills for successful end-to-end implementations of real-world applications.
* Coded the project’s backend for enhanced deployability using Java, and improved the frontend responsiveness on websites by making the map scalable and reactive to users using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
* Developed and deployed a zoomable web map with 7 zoom levels of the Great Seattle Area and integrated the navigation feature using the A* algorithm, and k-d tree with map data for optimal path computation speed.


#### Recommendation System for Amazon Electronics 
###### May 2021
###### Python, AWS, Spark
* Built a real-time recommendation system by implementing various recommendation models using real-world datasets. This recommendation system can be used to recommend and promote similar and relevant products to customers. 
* Developed a fully functional deployed application using AWS and Apache Spark. Specifically, the application’s backend, the recommendation system, is deployed on AWS with PySpark..
* Created a collaborative filtering product recommendation system tailored to users’ shopping preferences by analyzing open data via publicly available Amazon Electronics datasets.
* Designed a high-performing, 89% test prediction accuracy, collaborative filtering model to make optimal product recommendations to users using Jaccard similarity, Pearson similarity, and Cosine Similarity 


#### Images Captions Generator 
###### Mar 2022
###### Python, PyTorch, AWS
* Created an application to automatically generate captions based on raw image input capable of describing unnamed images to help dataset classification using deep learning models, leveraging distributed programming, and AWS to train of models.
* Trained a Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch, resnet50 by producing a representation of the images to a Long-Short Time Memory model as a caption generator to deterministically or stochastically generate captions.
* Achieved a final score of 70 Bi-Lingual Evaluation Understudy, with captions tailored for language and accuracy.
