It's been more than 6 months, and there is no offer for me. Unfortunately, I will graduate soon, and I have to find a job ASAP. Even though my parents comfort me and will take care of me for a period of time, the stress is overwhelming me. The good news is that there is no jobs can hurt my mental health now. Nevertheless, the bad news is that I have to get over this period of time.
