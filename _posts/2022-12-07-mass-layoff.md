Meta announced a mass layoff over 11,000 employees, and keep hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023. Other tech companies are also laying off. Unfortunately, there is only a few VOs so far, and it seems extremely difficult to get a job during the period of time of recession. Well, although I am kind of depressed and overwhelmed, I have to try my best in the following time. Good luck for myself and others who is also seeking for jobs.
